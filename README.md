The Youtube Data Analyser helps you analyse data using the Youtube API.

This tool allows you to pick any YouTube channel and it fetches all the information about that channel from YouTube servers.
Then it graphs the data. Total views,likes,comments for each published video.
By looking at the graphs, you’d be able to identify how the channel is doing overall, what kind of content gets the most attraction and so on. 
The tool will also show a table with all the information about the channel so if you find any abnormalities(a sudden jump in views maybe) within the graph around some region,
you can easily identify that region and maybe go on YouTube and see what caused that shift. The tool graphs published date differences between successive videos for the channel as well so you check for any patterns there too.


The tool also allows you to analyze and compare a number of different channels together. That is it allows you to graph two or more channels together in the same graphs for views, likes and comments. That way you’d be able to see patterns across channels. It also graphs likes/views and comments/views for each published video for those channels. This can roughly be taken as a measure of engagement for channels with different numbers of views.
